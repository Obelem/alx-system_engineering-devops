The Server
- The server in the diagram is located in a datacenter (a specially designed structure to hold thousands of machines).
- It could either be a physical or virtual (i.e an instance of a physical server).
- The server (physical or virtual) also runs a special operating system that helps it perform its services to the end users.

One Web Server
- An NGINX web server is installed in the server for serving "static" web content (i.e hard-coded content that needs no changes when delivered to the user) over the protocol, HTTP.

One Application Server
- This application server's fundamental purpose is to process web server requests and generate dynamic content from a business logic and application database in the backend.

One Database
- The primary role of the database is to store application data.

Domain Name / Domain Name System (DNS)
- The DNS helps translate the domain name record to an IP address
- The hosted website by the infrastructure; www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP address(IPV4), 8.8.8.8


Problems With This Infrastructure
- Server is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
This infrastructure design has no redundant server as a backup if the single server present failed. This presents a "single point of failure" as the application would crash due to the malfunctioning of the server.
- Downtime In Maintenance
Rebooting of the server after maintenance practice e.g deploying new code, would cause a downtime as the sole server would be unavailable for that period of time to carry out its functionalities for the clients.
- Unscalability
This infrastructure is unscalable due to its single server, web server, application server and absence of a load balancer to handle multiple requests to it.

Protocol
The server here uses the TCP/IP protocol to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website.
