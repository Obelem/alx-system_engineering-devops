The Server
- The server in the diagram is located in a datacenter (a specially designed structure to hold thousands of machines).
- It could either be a physical or virtual (i.e an instance of a physical server).
- The server (physical or virtual) also runs a special operating system that helps it perform its services to the end users.

The Web Server
- An NGINX web server is installed in the server for serving "static" web content (i.e hard-coded content that needs no changes when delivered to the user) over the protocol, HTTP.
