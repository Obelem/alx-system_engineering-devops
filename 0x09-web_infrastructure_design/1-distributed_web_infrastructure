Additional Elements
- One Web Server: 
extra web server is added to the previous infrastructure so that there is redundancy with the added server
- One Load Balancer (HAProxy): 
this is added to distribute the traffic between the two servers

Load Balancer Configuration
Load balancer is configured to have an active-active setup to both offer more computing capacity (due to the availability of multiple servers) and redundancy

Data Synchronization
The MySQL Master-Replica cluster used replication to keep data synchronized. This master-slave replication system prevents any downtime as the slave (which is a constant live backup of the database) can always be promoted to master if the original master server crashes.
