Additional Elements
- One Web Server: 
extra web server is added to the previous infrastructure so that there is redundancy with the added server
- One Load Balancer (HAProxy): 
this is added to distribute the traffic between the two servers

Load Balancer Configuration
Load balancer is configured to have an active-active setup to both offer more computing capacity (due to the availability of multiple servers) and redundancy

Data Synchronization
- The MySQL Master-Replica cluster used replication to keep data synchronized. This master-slave replication system prevents any downtime as the slave (which is a constant live backup of the database) can always be promoted to master if the original master server crashes.
- As the Master-Slave replication is a one-way replication (from master to slave), only the Master database node can accept reads/write while Replica can only accept reads

Problems With This Infrastructure
- The load balancer is a single point of failure as its failure would spell the crashing of this infrastructure
- No firewall on servers
- Traffic is unencrypted owing to the fact there is no TLS (or SSL) to encrypt the HTTP requests and responses
- No monitoring
